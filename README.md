**Description:**

ZMXuiCPBBM is a big bag conversion mod for SMXui. It consists of three modlets: ZMXuiCPBBM (63s), ZMXuiCPBBMxl (99s) & ZMXuiCPBBMxxl (110s). These modlets are dependant on each other so if you want to use 110 slots just keep them all but it will scale down the UI a bit to fit on screen. If you want to use 99 slots delete ZMXuiCPBBMxxl. If you want to use 63 slots delete the other two.

> Dependencies: SMXui.

> Compatibility: Will probably work with most mods/modlets that doesn't modify the same windows/areas in the XUI files and have a lower load order.
